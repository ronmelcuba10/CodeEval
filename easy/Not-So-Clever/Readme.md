#NOT SO CLEVER
##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

Imagine that you have to arrange items in a certain order: pencils from black to white in a color palette, photographs by the date taken, banknotes from the highest to the lowest, etc. To do this, you definitely don’t need to use the Stupid sort algorithm. 
 
After each action, you need to come back to the beginning and start all over again. Not so clever, is it? But, you need to know about this algorithm, that’s why it is used in this challenge.

##INPUT SAMPLE:

The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case which contains numbers that you need to sort using the Stupid sort algorithm. There is also a number of iterations for an algorithm to carry out. The numbers themselves and the number of iterations are separated by a pipeline '|'.


    4 3 2 1 | 1
    5 4 3 2 1 | 2

##OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print sorted numbers after they pass the required number of iterations. One iteration of this sort is a pass to the moment of making changes. Once changing the order of the digits, passing starts from the very beginning. Hence, this is another iteration.


    3 4 2 1
    4 3 5 2 1

##CONSTRAINTS:

* The number of iterations can be from 1 to 8.
* One iteration of this sort is a pass to the moment of making changes.
* The number of test cases is 40.
