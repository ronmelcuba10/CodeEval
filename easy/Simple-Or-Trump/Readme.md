#SIMPLE OR TRUMP
##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

First playing cards were invented in Eastern Asia and then spread all over the world taking different forms and appearance. In India, playing cards were round, and they were called Ganjifa. In medieval Japan, there was a popular Uta-garuta game, in which shell mussels were used instead of playing cards. 
In our game, we use playing cards that are more familiar nowadays. The rules are also simple: an ace beats a deuce (2) unless it is a trump deuce.

##INPUT SAMPLE:

The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case which contains two playing cards and a trump suit. Cards and a trump suite are separated by a pipeline (|). The card deck includes thirteen ranks (from a deuce to an ace) of each of the four suits: clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠). There are no Jokers.
