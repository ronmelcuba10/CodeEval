#MEET COCKTAIL SORT
##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

Quite often we need to arrange items in a certain order: numbers in an ascending or descending order, words – in an alphabetical order, people – according to their height, and so on. There are many different sorting algorithms. Some of them are quick, while others seem to suit in a particular case only. 
In this challenge, your task is to use a cocktail sort.

##INPUT SAMPLE:

The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case with numbers that you need to order using cocktail sort. There is also a number of iterations for an algorithm to carry out. The numbers themselves and the number of iterations are separated by a pipeline '|'.


    5 4 9 10 7 3 2 1 6 | 1
    9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 | 3

##OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print sorted numbers after they pass the required number of iterations. One iteration of a cocktail sort is a pass through the list of numbers in both directions: from the beginning to the end and from the end to the beginning.


    1 4 5 9 7 3 2 6 10
    1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9

##CONSTRAINTS:

*  The number of iterations can be from 1 to 30.
*  One iteration of a cocktail sort is a pass through the list of numbers in both directions: from the beginning to the end and from the end to the beginning.
*  The number of test cases is 40.
